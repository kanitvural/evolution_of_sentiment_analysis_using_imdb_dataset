       "review     Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. I must admit I was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly I'll be writing those recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, I assure you that you won't be disappointed.   \n",

       "8561   i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my universitys art museum on occasion well more like half of the time i am unable to watch the films there i have systematically attempted to view each of the films that i have missed so far plagues and pleasures on the salton sea and who killed the electric car are the other films that i have had to watch this way the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is welltheorized emphasis on this later but not as successful as plagues and pleasures but far superior to electric carthe films thesis concerns the future of the american concept of suburban living it questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise so the film discusses the origin of the suburb and its evolution until the early s one theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants while several people may live together they do not know each other as we define the word this to me represents the strength of the film its appeal to actual human emotion we are able to understand the filmmakers argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their arguments legitimacy this is also one of the reasons salton sea is such a wonderful documentaryunfortunately suburbia loses its message in fireand explanation in support of its central argument as those interviewed speak their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade but are given no scientific evidence professional reports statistics graphs etc in support of this claim we are given little information as to how this date was calculated fortunately this was the only significant flaw that i was able to detect in the films argument yet its a glaring one nevertheless another lessimportant discrepancy i noticed was the liberal political bias which could polarize some viewers however this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves the clips especially those from the s seemed a tad unnecessary to me the film was no better with their presence and would have been more concise in their absenceas i thought more of this film before composing this review i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that id recently viewed finally i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem they propose a decentralized villagesystem where pockets of people would live together they posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas for instance what is incredible about this supposition is that its actually conceivable most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so thinking more about the film i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a favorable reviewwhile neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation the end of suburbia is a worthwhile investment of ones time it not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the s spliced with the modern arguers people living in atlanta georgia or the triad region of north carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there   \n",
